gedermo being gedermo

bot needs to be deployed for heroku (which is free) for it to being 10/10 in the scale of gediento

code is easy to read just place the email of someone you want to really gedear, shout to the screen `watch me fly` and then start rolling

any doubts use google i just made this because i need a way to pursue my mother to let me get a dog

as long as you are gonna use this for gede purposes its fine by me i just dont wanna go to jail

7/2  > _getting spicy momma_ > added support for picking a random pic from a subdirectory
13/2 > deployed to heroku and working 100% spamming like a bawss 

*FYI*:  つ ◕_◕ ༽つ ofc keys and stuff are not in the repo cause reasons, so need to create a parallel branch where you DO include these (rm from the .gitignore) and push it to heroku つ ◕_◕ ༽つ
